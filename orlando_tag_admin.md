# Jeffery Antoniuk says about orlando_tag_admin.csv:

The attached contains the list of all elements and attributes.  The 'use_code' determines whether or not it is semantic (i.e. interesting enough to add to a searchable list of elements or attributes within Orlando) or not (i.e. structure).  Each element may occur multiple times, once for each type of content (e.g. event, bio, bibl) and once for each attribute of the element (e.g. 'pliteraryschools' with attribute 'involvement')
